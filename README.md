The following repo contains the basic to system design and keywords 

# Definition

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and data flow of a system to meet certain requirements — such as performance, scalability, reliability, and maintainability.


#  Two Main Types

1. High-Level Design (HLD):

Focuses on the overall structure — how components like databases, APIs, servers, and clients interact.

Example: Deciding if your system should be client–server, microservices, or monolithic.



2. Low-Level Design (LLD):

Focuses on implementation details —
classes, methods, data structures, and algorithms.

Example: How exactly a database query or cache is implemented.


# Basic Components

Every system generally includes:

Client: Where users interact (web app, mobile app).

Server: Handles logic and communication.

Database: Stores data.

Cache: Speeds up data access.

Load balancer: Distributes requests across servers.

API / Communication layer: Connects different parts of the system.


#  Common Goals

A good design should ensure:

Scalability: Can handle more users or data.

Reliability: Keeps running even if parts fail.

Performance: Responds quickly.

Security: Protects user data.

Maintainability: Easy to update or fix.
